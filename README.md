Executive Summary:
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) track total purchase costs and their monthly distribution through a simple line graph. A map visual identifies supplier locations, with interactive tooltips showing total orders and purchase costs per country.

Highlights:
Month-over-Month (MoM) Purchase Cost Growth: +0.07%
MoM Orders Growth: +0.05%
During the summer, a dip in company sales caused a temporary slowdown in warehouse activity. As demand recovered, franchisees increased orders, prompting higher purchase volumes to replinish warehouse stock.
